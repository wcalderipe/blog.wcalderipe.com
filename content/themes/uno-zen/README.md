**Uno Zen** is a fork of [Uno for Ghost](https://github.com/daleanthony/Uno) that provides some features missing in the original theme.

## Whats is new in 2.0

- Totally rewritten using HTML5 and CSS3.
- Improved development workflow with gulp + browersync.
- Improved responsive and mobile experience.
- Improved SEO Content with meta tags.

... and things that already existed:

- A good [404 page error](http://kikobeats.com/404).
- Search support.
- Multiaccount support.
- Loading progress state for each page.
- Estimation about the time of reading.

You can see a demo in my [blog](http://blog.kikobeats.com). Also you can check the [styleguide](kikobeats.com/styleguide) to view how it looks.
